# C++ DevKit Motivation
This repository proposes an abstraction layer above the Raspberry-pico SDK. This why its name is inspired from Pico-SDK : CPP_DevKit.

It is built with an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. the proposed classes are those that I've needed with the displays and sensor modules I have.
All the classes are developped with Raspberry Pi Pico VSCode extension. 

A special focus has been made on the usage of graphic widget and User Interface (UI).
I know that we can find lot of good works and well-defined GUI e.g. Adafruit in Arduino environment, but the main motivation, here, was first to enjoy developing (quite) from scratch a user interface in OOP C++.

Another motivation was to have a set of C++ OOP classes that makes development of Raspberry Pi Pico C++ applications more friendly with a small UI with OLED display (the ones I've got is the SSD1306 0.92" 128x64 and the ST7735).
Considering the time required to refresh the small OLED screen through the I2C or SPI serial busses, I've consider that it will be worth thinking about something that refreshes parts of the screen only when data have been changed. 
This is why I've started thinking about widget and the way we can upload those widget to a part of the display framebuffer.

Most of The code was derived from [Harbys github repository](https://github.com/Harbys/pico-ssd1306) works and widget framebuffer API was inspired from mycropython API we can find [here](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/framebuf.html#module-framebuf).

As a second step for this development I've found useful to consider FreeRTOS and DMA usage in order to aleviate MCU work load. This is why some classes are derived into a rtos_xxxx version.


## Background
During my professional period of activities, I've got knowledge about Model Based Engineering, Object Oriented Design, and Mathematical Abstractions in general. This is why I've based this development according to MVC design rules (Model View Control).
